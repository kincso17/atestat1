    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gucci is an Italian high-end luxury fashion house based in Florence, Italy. Its product lines include handbags, ready-to-wear, footwear,
accessories, and home decoration; and it licenses its name and branding to Coty, Inc. for fragrance and cosmetics under the name Gucci Beauty.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gucci was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci (1881–1953) in Florence, Tuscany. Under the direction of Aldo Gucci (son of Guccio), Gucci became 
a worldwide-known brand, an icon of the Italian Dolce Vita. Following family feuds during the 1980s, the Gucci family was entirely ousted from 
the capital of the company by 1993. After this crisis, the brand was revived with a provocative 'Porno Chic' props. In 1999, Gucci was acquired 
by the French conglomerate Pinault Printemps Redoute, which later became Kering. During the 2010s, Gucci became an iconic 'geek-chic' brand.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 2019, Gucci operated 487 stores for 17,157 employees, and generated €9.628 billion in sales. 
    Marco Bizzarri is CEO of Gucci since December 2014, and Alessandro Michele creative director 
    since January 2015. Gucci is a subsidiary of the French luxury group Kering. The Gucci family claims 
    its origins are rooted in the merchant city of Florence since around 1410. Guccio Giovanbattista
    Giacinto Dario Maria Gucci (1881–1953) left Florence for Paris, and settled in London in 1897 to 
    work at the high-end Savoy Hotel. While working as a bellhop there, he would load/unload the 
    luggage of the hotel's wealthy clients, learning about their tastes in fashion, quality, fabrics,
    and traveling conditions. He later worked four years for the Compagnie des Wagons-Lits, 
    the European rail company that specialized in upscale travel leisure, thus further enhancing his
    experience with luxurious traveling lifestyles. 
</p>

<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After World War I, he worked for the maker of fine
    luggage Franzi. In 1921, Guccio Gucci bought his own shop on Via della Vigna Nuova in Florence,
    Azienda Individuale Guccio Gucci,[8] where he sold imported leather luggage. He also opened a small
    workshop to have his own leather goods made by local craftsmen. Guccio's wife and children all 
    worked in the shop. Aldo, the son of Guccio, became increasingly involved in the family company 
    since he started working there in 1925. He convinced his father to grow by opening a new shop in 
    Rome (21 Via Condotti) in 1938, and launched more Gucci accessories (gloves, belts, wallets,
    keychains). During World War II, the artisans of Gucci worked on making boots for the Italian 
    infantry.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After the war, Guccio Gucci distributed the shares of the company to his three sons (Aldo,
    Vasco and Rodolfo). In 1947, Gucci launched the Bamboo bag. The brand launched its first global 
    tagline, Quality is remembered long after price is forgotten.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 1969, Giorgio, the son of Aldo, had sparked the first family feud by launching Gucci Boutique
    on his own, which was finally reabsorbed by the family group in 1972. During the 1980s, the Gucci 
    saga eroded the family-held top management of the company and fed the press headlines. Paolo Gucci,
    son of Aldo, tried to launch the brand Gucci Plus on his own. Aldo was criticized for developing
    most of the international business under Gucci America which he owned. In 1982, to ease tensions 
    in the family, the Gucci group was consolidated and became a publicly-traded company, Guccio Gucci SpA.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In May 1983, Rodolfo died. His son Maurizio Gucci inherited his father's majority stake in the 
    company and launched a legal war against his uncle Aldo for full control of Gucci (a prosecution 
    led by the city prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani, and with Domenico de Sole representing the Gucci family).
    Maurizio Gucci took over the company's direction. In 1986, Aldo Gucci, 81, with only 16.7% of Gucci
    left in his possession, was sentenced to a year in prison for tax evasion (in a prison where Albert
    Nipon was also an inmate). The artwork of the Gucci Galleria was liquidated. In 1988, Maurizio Gucci 
    sold almost 47.8% of Gucci to the Bahrain-based investment fund Investcorp (owner of Tiffany since 
    1984), and withheld the other 50%.
</p>

<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Despite the family disputes, between 1981 and 1987, the sales of trademarked Gucci products reached 
    $400 million, and $227 million in 1990 alone. The 1980s were characterized by a mass-production of 
    Gucci products, which generated revenue but negatively affected Gucci's position as an exclusive 
    luxury brand. Maurizio Gucci hired Dawn Mello to put Gucci back on tracks.
</p>

<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    From 1991 to 1993, Gucci's finances were still in the red, Maurizio Gucci was blamed for spending 
    extravagant amounts of money on the company's headquarters in Florence (Via delle Caldaie palazzo) 
    and in Milan. Investcorp bought the remaining 50% of Guccio Gucci S.p.A. from Maurizio Gucci in 1993, 
    ending the family involvement in the group. In March 1995, Maurizio Gucci was shot dead in the 
    lobby of Gucci's Milan office. His ex-wife Patrizia Reggiani served 16 years in jail for hiring 
    the hitman to murder him.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dawn Mello was hired in November 1989 as Gucci's executive vice president and chief designer. 
    She reduced the number of stores from over 1,000 to 180 in a move to rebuild the brand's 
    exclusivity. She also reduced the number of items sold by Gucci from 22,000 to 7,000. She revived 
    the Bamboo bag and the Gucci loafer.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Following Ford's departure, Gucci Group retained three designers to continue the success of the 
    company's flagship label: John Ray, Alessandra Facchinetti and Frida Giannini, all of whom had 
    worked under Ford's creative direction. Facchinetti was elevated to Creative Director of Women's 
    wear in 2004 and designed for two seasons before leaving the company. Ray served as Creative 
    Director of Menswear for three years. Frida Giannini – a Gucci handbag designer since 2002, head 
    of accessories since 2004, and creative director of women's ready-to-wear and accessories since 
    2005 – was appointed creative director of Gucci in 2006.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After initially announcing plans for a movie about the Gucci dynasty in 2007, filmmaker Ridley 
    Scott detailed specifics about his movie in November 2019; titled House of Gucci, the movie would 
    star Lady Gaga as Patrizia Reggiani and Adam Driver as Maurizio Gucci. House of Gucci 's world 
    premiere took place at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on November 9, 2021. In 2000, 
    Martin Scorsese had also announced plans to make a movie about the Gucci family.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In the history of Gucci, up until the end of the Gucci family era, the design, promotion, and 
    production of Gucci products were handled by the members of the Gucci family.
