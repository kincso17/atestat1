    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Fendi is an Italian luxury fashion house producing fur, ready-to-wear, leather goods, shoes, 
    fragrances, eyewear, timepieces and accessories. Founded in Rome in 1925, Fendi is known for 
    its fur and fur accessories, and for its leather goods. Since 2001 Fendi has been part of the 
    “Fashion & Leather Goods” division of the French group LVMH. Its headquarters are in Rome, 
    in the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The house of Fendi was launched in 1926 by Adele and Edoardo Fendi (1904-1954) as a fur and leather 
    shop in Via del Plebiscito, Rome. In 1932 Adele and Edoardo Fendi opened a boutique in via Piave; 
    the shop becomes one of the most popular destinations for foreign tourists visiting Rome.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    From 1946, the five sisters Paola, Anna, Franca, Carla and Alda joined the company in its second 
    generation as a family-owned enterprise and each owned 20 percent. Karl Lagerfeld joined Fendi in 
    1965 and became the creative director of the luxury fashion label's fur and women's ready-to-wear 
    collection (launched in 1977).
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 1966 Lagerfeld created the company logo with the double F in a square version which will 
    later be the subject of various reinterpretations. Also, in 1966 Fendi presented its first high 
    fashion collection, expanding its interests in the United States and Japan. In 1969 the first 
    commercial line of fur was launched and, in the following years, cosmetics and men accessories. 
    In 1977 Fendi introduced clothing for the first time, with a ready to wear collection.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Fendi has 215 stores worldwide.In the 1980s, Fendi expanded its range with perfumes (1985), eyewear, 
    jeans and home furnishings.In 1994, Paola Fendi handed over the presidency of the company to her 
    younger sister Carla. Silvia Venturini Fendi, daughter of Anna, also joined the fashion house 
    in 1994 and has since been the artistic director for accessories and co-designer of the women's 
    line alongside Lagerfeld; in 1997 she designed the Baguette Bag, an iconic model that beats all 
    sales and notoriety records.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Fendi was a family-controlled company until 1999, when Prada and LVMH, the world's biggest luxury 
    goods group, joined forces to buy 51 percent of Fendi.Carla Fendi, a member of the founding 
    family, continued to act as chairwoman and a minority owner until 2008.

On 19 October 2007, Fendi chooses the Great Wall of China to present the spring-summer collection and 
shows 88 models, creating the first ever fashion show there.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 2009 Silvia Venturini Fendi created the Peekaboo bag, achieving a success comparable to the 
    Baguette Bag.

    In 2014, Fendi started making plans to use drones to show its catwalk fashions. From 2013 until 
    2021, the company had a brand licensing agreement with Safilo for the design, production and worldwide
     distribution of Fendi sunglasses and optical frames.

    men's and women's collections. From September 2020 the women's collection has been entrusted 
    to Kim Jones, former stylist for the Dior men's collection, who is appointed artistic 
    director of couture and womenswear. Silvia Venturini remains artistic director of accessories 
    and menswear.
