    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Yves Saint Laurent SAS, also known by Saint Laurent and YSL, is a French luxury fashion house founded 
    by Yves Saint Laurent and his partner Pierre Bergé in 1962. Saint Laurent specializes in haute 
    couture, ready-to-wear, leather accessories, and footwear. Its cosmetics line, YSL Beauty, is owned 
    by L'Oréal.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The eponymous brand was founded in 1962 by designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé. 
    The brand’s logos were designed in 1963 by A. M. Cassandre. During the 1960s and 1970s, YSL 
    popularized the beatnik look, safari jackets, tight pants, and thigh-high boots. In 1966, 
    YSL debuted Le Smoking, a tuxedo suit for women. In an attempt to democratize fashion.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    YSL began producing ready-to-wear in 1966, with its launch of Rive Gauche, and is considered to be 
    the first to popularize the concept. YSL’s designs often featured designs influenced from traditional 
    Chinese clothing, as well as themes from Pop Art, Ballet Russes, and Picasso. Saint Laurent is 
    credited with initiating the broad, shoulder-padded style in 1978 that would go on to characterize 
    1980s fashion. Saint Laurent's muses included Loulou de La Falaise, Betty Catroux, Talitha Pol-Getty, 
    and Catherine Deneuve.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The brand expanded in the 1980s and early 1990s with men’s and women’s fragrances and its cosmetic 
    line in 1978. However, by 1992, the company's profits were in decline and its share price had fallen.
     In 1993, Saint Laurent was sold to pharmaceuticals company Sanofi.

</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1999, Kering purchased YSL and hired Tom Ford to design the ready-to-wear collection, while Yves Saint 
Laurent himself would design the haute couture collection. Designs by Tom Ford For YSL were chosen 
Dress of the Year by the Fashion Museum in 2001 and 2004.

</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 2002, after years of poor health, drug abuse, depression, alcoholism, and criticisms of YSL 
    designs, Saint Laurent closed the couture division of YSL. "Chanel freed women, and I empowered 
    them," Saint Laurent was quoted, reflecting on his career and impact on fashion, "I created the 
    contemporary woman's wardrobe." In 2004, Tom Ford departed the company and Stefano Pilati, an 
    Italian-born designer became creative director. Yves Saint Laurent died of brain cancer in 2008. 
    The following few years proved to be tumultuous for the company.

</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 2012, Kering announced Hedi Slimane replaced Stefano Pilati as creative director for YSL. 
Slimane previously worked with Dior Homme until 2007. In 2015, Slimane announced he would revive 
Yves Saint Laurent's couture line. In 2016, Slimane left Saint Laurent and Anthony Vaccarello was 
appointed creative director, a position he still holds as of August 2022.

</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Despite Slimane previously working with the house, there was controversy following his appointment, 
    particularly after the announcement the ready-to-wear line would be rebranded “Saint Laurent” 
    (dropping “Yves” from its name). ”Yves Saint Laurent” and the YSL vertical monogram logo would 
    remain for accessories.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Parisian boutique Colette began selling shirts with the line "Ain't Laurent without Yves." 
    Saint Laurent requested the store stop selling the shirts (which it did on its online store)

    In 2019, Saint Laurent launched its lifestyle-brand Rive Droite, in which exclusive merchandise, 
    collector's items, and curated experiences are made available at Paris and Los Angeles.
