    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Burberry is a British luxury fashion house established in 1856 by Thomas Burberry and headquartered 
    in London. It currently designs and distributes ready to wear, including trench coats (for which 
    it is most famous), leather accessories, and footwear. Its name and branding are licensed to Coty 
    for fragrances and cosmetics and to Luxottica for eyewear.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Burberry was founded in 1856 when 21-year-old Thomas Burberry, a former draper's apprentice, opened
 his own store in Basingstoke, Hampshire, England. By 1870, the business had established itself by 
 focusing on the development of outdoors attire. In 1879, Burberry introduced gabardine to his brand, a
  hardwearing, water-resistant yet breathable fabric, in which the yarn is waterproofed before weaving.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Adapted to meet the needs of military personnel, the "trench coat" was born during the First World 
    War due to its being worn by British officers in the trenches. After the war, it became popular with 
    civilians. The Burberry check has been in use since at least the 1920s, primarily as a lining in its 
    trench coats. Burberry also specially designed aviation garments. In 1937, A. E. Clouston and Betty 
    Kirby-Green broke the world record for the fastest return flight from London to Cape Town in The 
    Burberry airplane that was sponsored by the brand. Burberry was an independent family-controlled 
    company until 1955, when Great Universal Stores (GUS) assumed ownership.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Stars of the modern world began wearing the Burberrys brand. During the 1970s and 1980s, Burberry 
    signed agreements with worldwide manufacturers to produce complementary products to the existing 
    British collection such as suits, trousers, shirts, sportswear, accessories, for men, ladies, and 
    children. These products, designed under the strict control of headquarters in London, were produced 
    and distributed through independent retail stores worldwide as well as the Burberry stores, and 
    contributed to the growth of the brand in sales and profits through to the late 90s, although the 
    full extent of sales was not apparent in the parent company accounts since much was done through 
    licensed agreements.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In May 2001, Christopher Bailey joined Burberry as creative director. Christopher Bailey has been 
    the chief creative officer since 2014, as well as CEO from 2014 – November 2017. Bailey stepped 
    down as chief creative officer in March 2018 and departed the brand completely by the end of 2018.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 2006, Rose Marie Bravo, who as chief executive had led Burberry to mass market success through 
    licensing, decided to retire. She was replaced by another American, Angela Ahrendts.

    Burberry first sold online in the US, then in the UK in October 2006, and the rest of the EU in
     2007. Bailey became Chief Creative Officer in November 2009.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In July 2016, it was announced that Celine boss Marco Gobbetti would become CEO of the FTSE 100 
    Company, while Christopher Bailey became the Creative Director and President. In 2016, the label 
    launched its "Mr Burberry" fragrance.

    In May 2018, it was reported that Burberry had filed a lawsuit against Target claiming that Target 
    had copied its check print designs and was seeking amount of $2 million, in addition to the amount 
    to cover its legal fees.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In July 2018, it was reported that in the previous past five years Burberry had destroyed unsold 
    clothes, accessories and perfume worth over £90m in order to protect its brand and prevent the 
    items being stolen or sold cheaply.

    In February 2019, Burberry apologized for showcasing a hoodie that featured a noose around the 
    neck during its show at London Fashion Week. The retailer said it has removed the item from its 
    collection, after criticism from one of its own models led to an online backlash.
    
    In 2021, Burberry announced that it would become a 'climate positive' company by 2040.
