    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gianni Versace S.r.l., usually referred to as Versace, is an Italian luxury fashion company 
    founded by Gianni Versace in 1978 known for flashy prints and bright colors. The company produces 
    Italian-made ready-to-wear and accessories, as well as haute couture under its Atelier Versace brand 
    and licenses its name and branding to Luxottica for eyewear. Versace's logo is inspired by Medusa.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 1972, Gianni Versace designed his first collections for Callaghan, Genny, and Complice. In 1978, 
    the company launched under the name "Gianni Versace Donna” and opened its first boutique in 
    Milan's Via della Spiga. Gianni independently controlled much of the brand, from designing 
    to retailing. In 1982, the company expanded its offerings to include accessories, jewelry, home 
    furnishings, and china. In 1993, Donatella Versace added the Young Versace and Versus lines. 
    In 1994, the brand gained international coverage from the black Versace dress of Elizabeth Hurley, 
    referred in the media as "that dress".
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Versace has designed for various music artists, including stage and album cover costumes for Elton 
    John in 1992 and outfits for Michael Jackson. Versace also designed clothing for the Princess of 
    Wales and Princess Caroline of Monaco.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After the murder of Gianni Versace in 1997, his sister Donatella, formerly vice-president, took 
    over as creative director, and his older brother Santo Versace became CEO. Donatella's daughter 
    Allegra Versace was left a 50 percent stake in the company, which she assumed control of on her 
    eighteenth birthday.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 2000, the green Versace dress worn by Jennifer Lopez at the Grammy Awards gained extensive 
    media attention. The dress was voted the fifth most iconic dress of all time and Elizabeth Hurley's 
    black Versace dress was voted most iconic dress of all time, according to a 2008 Daily Telegraph poll.

</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In February 2014, The Blackstone Group purchased a 20 percent stake in Versace for €210 million.

As of 2016, more than 1500 boutiques operate worldwide.

In September 2018, Michael Kors offered to buy Versace for two billion euros. Versace announced all 
Blackstone and Versace family shares were sold to Michael Kors Limited. The acquisition was completed 
in December 2018, with Donatella Versace remaining head of creative design.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Soheil Abedian, of Sunland Group, approached Versace in 1997 proposing a luxury hotel built for 
    the Versace brand. The first Palazzo Versace opened on Australia's Gold Coast on 15 September 2000.
     The hotel was sold to a Chinese consortium in December 2012. The second Palazzo, the Palazzo 
     Versace Dubai, was completed in December 2015 and is located on the foreshore of Dubai Creek. 
     A third Palazzo, the Palazzo Versace Macau, is under construction as part of a partnership with 
     Macau's largest casino operator SJM Holdings. The Palazzo Versace hotels are the world's first 
     fashion-branded hotels.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In August 2019, Versace produced a range of tops suggesting Hong Kong and Macau were separate 
    countries. Versace apologized, saying it made a mistake in the design and would destroy the offending 
    clothing. In response to the controversy, Yang Mi ended her relationship as brand ambassador for 
    Versace.
