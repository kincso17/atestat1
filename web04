    Christian Dior SE, commonly known as Dior, is a French luxury fashion house controlled and chaired 
    by French businessman Bernard Arnault. The company was founded in 1946 by French fashion designer 
    Christian Dior (1905–1957), who was originally from Normandy. This brand sells 
    shoes and clothing exclusive to Dior boutiques. Haute couture is under the Christian Dior Couture 
    division. Pietro Beccari has been the CEO 
    of Christian Dior Couture since 2018.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The House of Dior was established on 16 December 1946 at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris. However, the current Dior corporation celebrates "1947"
    as the opening year. Dior was financially backed by wealthy businessman Marcel Boussac. Boussac had originally invited Dior to design for 
    Philippe et Gaston, but Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    On 12 February 1947, Christian Dior launched his first fashion collection for Spring–Summer 1947. The show of "90 models of his first collection
    on six mannequins" was presented in the salons of the company's headquarters at 30 Avenue Montaigne. Originally, the two lines were named "Corolle" 
    and "Huit". However, the new collection went down in fashion history as the "New Look" after the editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar Carmel Snow exclaimed, 
    "It's such a new look!". The New Look was a revolutionary era for women at the end of the 1940s. When the collection was presented, the editor in 
    chief also showed appreciation by saying; "It’s quite a revolution, dear Christian!". The debut collection of Christian Dior is credited with having 
    revived the fashion industry of France. Along with that, the New Look brought back the spirit of haute couture in France as it was considered
    glamorous and young-looking. "We were witness to a revolution in fashion and to a revolution in showing fashion as well.". The silhouette was characterized
    by a small, nipped-in waist and a full skirt falling below mid-calf length, which emphasized the bust and hips, as epitomized by the 'Bar' suit from the
    first collection. The collection overall showcased more stereotypically feminine designs in contrast to the popular fashions of wartime, with full 
    skirts, tight waists, and soft shoulders. Dior retained some of the masculine aspects as they continued to hold popularity through the early 1940s, but
    he also wanted to include more feminine style.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Expansion from France began by the end of 1949 with the opening of a Christian Dior boutique in New York City. By the end of the year, Dior
    fashions made up 75% of Paris's fashion exports and 5% of France's total export revenue.
    
    Christian Dior appeared on the cover of TIME dated 4 March 1957. The designer soon afterwards died from a third heart attack on 24 October 1957.
    The captivating impact of Dior's creative fashion genius earned him recognition as one of history's greatest fashion figures. Kevin Almond for 
    Contemporary Fashion wrote that "by the time Dior died his name had become synonymous with taste and luxury."
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To bring the label back on its feet, Rouët promoted the 21-year-old Yves Saint-Laurent to Artistic Director the same year.
    Laurent had joined the House's family in 1955 after being picked out by the original designer himself for the position of the first ever and
    only Head Assistant. Laurent initially proved to have been the most appropriate choice after the debut of his first collection for Dior 
    in 1958. The clothes were as meticulously made and perfectly proportioned as Dior's in the same exquisite fabrics, but their young designer made
    them softer, lighter and easier to wear. Saint Laurent was hailed as a national hero.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The company operates a total of 210 locations.

    Dior has created strong partnerships with Hollywood celebrities and social media influencers, working closely with these individuals to reach more
    demographics and re-establish its identity as a new, modern brand, despite the fact that it has been around for a while. This has allowed the brand 
    to portray a more populist image and attract a wider audience.
