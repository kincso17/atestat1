    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Chanel is a French luxury fashion house founded in 1910 by Coco Chanel in Paris. Chanel specializes 
    in women's ready-to-wear, luxury goods, and accessories and licenses its name and branding to
     Luxottica for eyewear. Chanel is well known for its No. 5 perfume and "Chanel Suit". Chanel is 
     credited for revolutionizing haute couture and ready-to-wear by replacing structured, corseted 
     silhouettes with more functional garments that women still found flattering.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The House of Chanel originated in 1909 when Gabrielle Chanel opened a millinery shop at 160 Boulevard 
    Malesherbes, the ground floor of the Parisian flat of the socialite and textile businessman Étienne 
    Balsan, of whom she was the mistress. Because the Balsan flat also was a salon for the French hunting
     and sporting élite, Chanel had the opportunity to meet their demi-mondaine mistresses who, as such,
      were women of fashion, upon whom the rich men displayed their wealth – as ornate clothes, jewellery,
       and hats.
Coco Chanel used jersey cloth because of its physical properties as a garment, such as its drape – how 
it falls upon and falls from the body of the woman – and how well it adapted to a simple garment-design.

</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 1921, to complement Chanel's clothing lines, Coco Chanel commissioned perfumer Ernest Beaux to 
    create a perfume for La Maison Chanel. His perfumes included the perfume No.5, named after the number
     of the sample Chanel liked best. Originally, given as a gift to clients, No.5's popularity prompted
      La Maison Chanel to offer it for sale in 1922.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The success of the No. 5 encouraged Coco Chanel to expand perfume sales beyond France and Europe
     and to develop other perfumes – for which she required investment capital, business acumen, and
      access to the North American market.

By 1937, the House of Chanel had expanded the range of its clothes to more women and presented 
prêt-à-porter clothes designed and cut for the petite woman. Among fashion designers, only the clothes 
created by Elsa Schiaparelli could compete with the clothes of Chanel.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The House of Chanel also presented leather handbags with either gold-colour chains or metal-and-leather
     chains, which allowed carrying the handbag from the shoulder or in hand. The quilted-leather handbag
      was presented to the public in February 1955. In-house, the numeric version of the launching date 
      "2.55" for that line of handbags became the internal "appellation" for that model of the
       quilted-leather handbag.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Coco Chanel died on 10 January 1971, at the age of 87. She was still designing at the time of her 
    death. For example, in the (1966–1969) period, she designed the air hostess uniforms for Olympic 
    Airways, the designer who followed her was Pierre Cardin. In that time, Olympic Airways was a 
    luxury airline, owned by the transport magnate Aristotle Onassis. After her death, the leadership 
    of the company was handed down to Yvonne Dudel, Jean Cazaubon and Philippe Guibourgé. So far, the
     bags designed by Chanel are still very popular in the vintage market.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    No. 5 de Chanel was not selling well. Alain revamped Chanel No.5 sales by reducing the number of 
    outlets carrying the fragrance from 18,000 to 12,000. He removed the perfume from drugstore shelves
     and invested millions of dollars in advertisement for Chanel cosmetics. This ensured a greater
      sense of scarcity and exclusivity for No.5, and sales rocketed back up as demand for the fragrance
       increased. He used famous people to endorse the perfume – from Marilyn Monroe to Audrey Tautou. 
       Looking for a designer who could bring the label to new heights, he persuaded Karl Lagerfeld 
       to end his contract with fashion house Chloé.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 1994, Chanel had a net profit equivalent to €67 million on the sale of €570 million in 
    ready-to-wear clothes and was the most profitable French fashion house.

Chanel introduced Coco Mademoiselle and an "In-Between Wear" in 2003, targeting younger women, 
opened a second shop on Rue Cambon, opened a 2,400 square feet (220 m2) boutique in Central, Hong Kong, 
and paid nearly US$50 million for a building in Ginza, Tokyo.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Chanel logotype comprises two interlocked, opposed letters-C, one faced left, one faced right. 
    The logotype was given to Chanel by the Château de Crémat, Nice, and was not registered as a 
    trademark until the first Chanel shops were established. The logo is commonly known to stand for 
    "Coco Chanel" and has become one of the most recognizable logos in the world. It has also become 
    the symbol of prestige, luxury, and class.
