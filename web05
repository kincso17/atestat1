        Louis Vuitton Malletier, commonly known as Louis Vuitton, is a French luxury fashion house and company
         founded in 1854 by Louis Vuitton. The label's LV monogram appears on most of its products, ranging
          from luxury bags and leather goods to ready-to-wear, shoes, watches, jewelry, accessories, 
          sunglasses and books. Louis Vuitton is one of the world's leading international fashion houses. 
          It sells its products through standalone boutiques, lease departments in high-end departmental 
          stores, and through the e-commerce section of its website.For six consecutive years (2006–2012),
           Louis Vuitton was named the world's most valuable luxury brand. The company operates in 50 
           countries with more than 460 stores worldwide.
        </p>
    <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The Louis Vuitton label was founded by Vuitton in 1854 on Rue Neuve des Capucines in Paris, 
            France. Louis Vuitton started at $10,567 as a sales price. Louis Vuitton had observed that
             the HJ Cave Osilite trunk could be easily stacked. In 1858, Vuitton introduced his 
             flat-topped trunks with Trianon canvas, making them lightweight and airtight. 
             Before the introduction of Vuitton's trunks, rounded-top trunks were used, generally to 
             promote water runoff, and thus could not be stacked. It was Vuitton's gray Trianon canvas 
             flat trunk that allowed the ability to stack them on top of another with ease for voyages. 
             Many other luggage makers later imitated Vuitton's style and design.
    </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Soon thereafter, due to the continuing imitation of his look, in 1888, Vuitton created 
                the Damier Canvas pattern, which bore a logo that reads "marque L. Vuitton déposée", 
                which translates into "L. Vuitton registered trademark". In 1892, Louis Vuitton died, 
                and the company's management passed to his son.

                After the death of his father, Georges Vuitton began a campaign to build the company into 
                a worldwide corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    During this period, Louis Vuitton began to incorporate leather into most of its products, 
                    which ranged from small purses and wallets to larger pieces of luggage. In order to broaden its line,
                     the company revamped its signature Monogram Canvas in 1959 to make it more supple, allowing it to 
                     be used for purses, bags, and wallets. It is believed that in the 1920s, counterfeiting returned as 
                     a greater issue to continue on into the 21st century.

                    In 1997, Louis Vuitton made Marc Jacobs its Artistic Director. In March of the following year, 
                    he designed and introduced the company's first "prêt-à-porter" line of clothing for men and women.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        By 2001, Stephen Sprouse, in collaboration with Marc Jacobs, designed a limited-edition
                         line of Vuitton bags that featured graffiti written over the monogram pattern. The graffiti read 
                         Louis Vuitton and, on certain bags, the name of the bag (such as Keepall and Speedy). Certain 
                         pieces, which featured the graffiti without the Monogram Canvas background, were only available 
                         on Louis Vuitton's V.I.P. customer list. Jacobs also created the charm bracelet, the first-ever 
                         piece of jewelry from LV, within the same year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            In 2003, Takashi Murakami, in collaboration with Marc Jacobs, masterminded the new Monogram
                            Multicolore canvas range of handbags and accessories. This range included the monograms of the 
                            standard Monogram Canvas but in 33 different colors on either a white or black background. (The 
                            classic canvas features gold monograms on a brown background.) Murakami also created the Cherry 
                            Blossom pattern, in which smiling cartoon faces in the middle of pink and yellow flowers were 
                            sporadically placed atop the Monogram Canvas. This pattern appeared on a limited number of pieces.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                In 2004, Louis Vuitton celebrated its 150th anniversary.

                                The Louis Vuitton brand and the LV monogram are among the world's most valuable brands.
                                
                                Since the 19th century, Louis Vuitton trunks have been made by hand.
                                
                                Iconic bags of Louis Vuitton include the Speedy bag and Neverfull bags which comes in three sizes:
                                 Petite Modele, Moyene Modele] and Grand Modele. Each season Louis Vuitton produces rare, 
                                 limited edition bags that are generally only available by reservation through larger Louis 
                                 Vuitton stores.
                                
                                The company commonly uses print ads in magazines and billboards in cosmopolitan cities.
                                
                                Louis Vuitton has had many collaborations with prominent artists and designers.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    In May 2017, media reported on alleged mistreatment of Louis Vuitton exclusive model Ulrikke 
                                    Høyer who was to appear on a Louis Vuitton cruise show in Kyoto. The 20-year-old model, who, on 
                                    arrival, measured 91.5 cm (36 in) around her hips, was told she was "too bloated" and "too big" 
                                    for her ensemble and instructed to drink only water for 24 hours. The model alleged that she was 
                                    only informed via her agent in France, who received an email including the text "[she] came 
                                    yesterday in Tokyo to do her final fitting, and she doesn't fit the exact same dress anymore. She
                                     has a belly, her face is more puffy [sic] and the back of her dress is open and you can see it is 
                                     tight." Despite following the instructions, she was eventually excluded from the show. The model 
                                     stated that she has "received hundreds of messages from models" who have experienced similar 
                                     mistreatment from the same Louis Vuitton casting director. The casting director denied the 
                                     allegations and explained the instructions regarding intake of water as a misunderstanding, 
                                     that the model was instructed that her intake of liquids was to be limited to water.
