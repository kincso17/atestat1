    Balenciaga SA is a luxury fashion house founded in 1919 by the Spanish designer Cristóbal Balenciaga 
    in San Sebastian, Spain. Called "the master of us all" by Christian Dior, Balenciaga had a reputation 
    as a couturier of uncompromising standards. His bubble skirts and odd, feminine, yet modern 
    silhouettes became the trademarks of the house. Balenciaga produces ready-to-wear, footwear, 
    handbags, and accessories; and it licenses its name and branding to Coty for fragrances.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Cristóbal Balenciaga opened his first boutique in San Sebastián, Spain, in 1919, and expanded to 
    include branches in Madrid and Barcelona. The Spanish royal family and the aristocracy wore his 
    designs. When the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his stores, Balenciaga moved to Paris.

Balenciaga's success was nearly immediate. In the period of two years, the press lauded him as a 
revolutionary, and his designs were highly sought-after.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Customers risked their safety to travel to Europe during World War II to see Balenciaga's clothing. 
    During this period, he was noted for his "square coat", with sleeves cut in a single piece with the 
    yoke, and for his designs with black (or black and brown) lace over bright pink fabric.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The company was one of only 60 companies allowed to operate during the occupation, and the ongoing 
    supply of raw materials from Spain, which were in short supply in Paris at the time due to the war, 
    gave Balenciaga a competitive advantage. However, Balenciaga testified that he refused Hitler's 
    request to transfer his company's activities to Berlin.

<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    However, it was not until the post-war years that the full scale of the inventiveness of this highly 
    original designer became evident. His lines became more linear and sleek, diverging from the 
    hourglass shape popularized by "Christian Dior's New Look". The fluidity of his silhouettes 
    enabled him to manipulate the relationship between his clothing and women's bodies. In 1951, he 
    transformed the silhouette, broadening the shoulders and removing the waist. In 1955, he designed 
    the tunic dress, which later developed into the chemise dress of 1958. Other contributions in 
    the postwar era included the spherical balloon jacket (1953), the high-waisted baby doll dress 
    (1957), the cocoon coat (1957), the balloon skirt (1957), and the sack dress (1957).

Empire line, with high-waisted dresses and coats cut like kimono. His manipulation of the waist, in 
particular, contributed to "what is considered to be his most important contribution to the world of 
fashion: a new silhouette for women."

In the 1960s, Balenciaga was an innovator in his use of fabrics: he tended toward heavy fabrics, 
intricate embroidery, and bold materials. His trademarks included "collars that stood away from the 
collarbone to give a swanlike appearance" and shortened "bracelet" sleeves. His often spare, sculptural 
creations—including funnel-shape gowns of stiff duchess satin worn to acclaim by clients.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jackie Kennedy famously upset her husband by buying Balenciaga's expensive creations while John F.
     Kennedy was president, he apparently feared that the American public might think the purchases too 
     lavish. Her haute couture bills were eventually discreetly paid by her father-in-law, Joseph Kennedy.

    Cristóbal Balenciaga closed his fashion house in 1968 and died in 1972. The house lay dormant 
    until 1986.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In March 2011 at San Francisco's M. H. de Young Museum, Balenciaga celebrated the opening of 
    Balenciaga and Spain, a 120-piece fashion retrospective of Cristóbal Balenciaga's career. The 
    exhibition included many designs from the museum's encyclopedic costume collection. "You can't 
    even measure it", said Rodarte designer Laura Mulleavy of Cristóbal Balenciaga's influence.

    In March 2022 during Paris Fashion Week, Balenciaga expressed support for Ukraine during the 
    Russian-Ukrainian War. T-shirts in yellow and blue (like the Ukrainian flag) were placed on the 
    chairs.
