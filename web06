        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Prada S.p.A. is an Italian luxury fashion house founded in 1913 by Mario Prada. It specializes
        in leather handbags, travel accessories, shoes, ready-to-wear, and other fashion accessories. 
        Prada licenses its name and branding to Luxottica for eyewear and L’Oréal for fragrances.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The company was started in 1913 by Mario Prada and his brother Martino as a leather goods 
        shop – Fratelli Prada – in Milan, Italy. Initially, the shop sold animal goods and imported 
        English steamer trunks and handbags.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Mario Prada did not believe that women should have a role in business, and so he prevented 
        female family members from entering his company. Ironically, Mario's son had no interest in 
        the business, so it was Mario's daughter Luisa who succeeded Mario and ran Prada for almost 
        twenty years. Luisa's daughter, Miuccia Prada, joined the company in 1970, eventually taking 
        over from Luisa in 1978.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Miuccia began making waterproof backpacks out of Pocono, a nylon fabric. She met Patrizio 
        Bertelli in 1977, an Italian who had begun his own leather goods business at the age of 24, 
        and he joined the company soon after. He advised Miuccia on company business, which she followed. 
        It was his advice to discontinue importing English goods and to change the existing luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She released her first set of backpacks and totes in 1979. They were made out of a tough 
        military spec black nylon that her grandfather had used as coverings for steamer trunks. 
        Initial success was not instant, as they were hard to sell due to the lack of advertising 
        and high prices, but the lines would go on to become her first commercial hit.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The next big release was a nylon tote. That same year, the house of Prada began expansion 
        across continental Europe and the United States by opening locations in prominent shopping
         districts within Florence, Paris, Madrid, and New York City. A shoe line was also released 
         in 1984. In 1985 Miuccia released the "classic Prada handbag" that became an overnight 
         sensation. Although practical and sturdy, its sleek lines and craftsmanship had a luxury 
         that has become the Prada signature.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Prada's popularity increased when the fashion world took notice of its clean lines, opulent 
        fabrics, and basic colors. The logo for the label was not as obvious a design element as 
        those on bags from other prominent luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton. Prada's originality 
        made it one of the most influential fashion houses, and the brand became a premium status 
        symbol in the 1990s. In 1992, the high fashion brand Miu Miu, named after Miuccia's nickname, 
        launched. Miu Miu catered to younger consumers and celebrities. By 1993 Prada was awarded the 
        Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for accessories.

        The Prada Spring/Summer 2009 Ready-to-Wear fashion show, held on 23 September 2008 in Milan, 
        got infamous coverage because all the models on the catwalk were tottering[8] – several of 
        them stumbled, while two models fell down in front of the photographers and had to be helped 
        by spectators to get up. They removed their shoes in order to continue their walk. One more 
        model (Sigrid Agren) even had to stop and go back during the finale walk as she couldn't 
        manage walking in her high heels any longer. Interviewed right after the show, one model 
        declared: "I was having a panic attack, my hands were shaking. The heels were so high." 
        The designer Miuccia Prada, on her side, did not blame the height of the shoes, but the silk 
        little socks inside, which were slippery and moved inside of the shoes, preventing the models' 
        feet from having a correct grip on the sole. Miuccia Prada also assured that the shoes sold 
        in stores would have a lower heel, and that the little socks would be sewn into the shoes in 
        order to prevent further slips. But many fashionistas rightly claimed that the socks, once sewn 
        into the shoes, would be non-washable and would quickly stink and become grey. Consequently, 
        the shoes have never been commercially sold.

        Films
The 1999 feature film 10 Things I Hate About You features the following exchange extolling the virtues 
of Prada ownership:

<br>Bianca: You know, there's a difference between like and love. I like my Skechers but I love my 
Prada backpack.

<br>Chastity: But I love my Skechers.

<br>Bianca: That’s because you don’t have a Prada backpack.

        The 2006 feature film The Devil Wears Prada (based on the 2003 book of the same name written 
        by Lauren Weisberger) earned Meryl Streep an Oscar nomination for her role. Her shoe wardrobe
         for the film was said to be "at least 40% Prada" by the costume designer Patricia Field.
          Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue and the supposed inspiration for Meryl 
          Streep's character, wore Prada to the film's premiere.
